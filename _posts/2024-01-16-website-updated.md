Welcome to my personal fan website for Darkages! You can find some links at the top of the site, or in a 3-line "hamburger" menu:

- About: a brief introduction for myself
- Adventure Log: various new (2024+) in-game screenshots and narrations
- Memories: a collection of old in-game screenshots, mostly from 2006-2010


(Coming Soon:)
- Getting Started guide: interested in joining this crazy game??
- Links: other immensely useful Darkages websites
- Misc: various things that don't fit into a nice category yet
- Projects: a few fun games / projects that I want to work on

NOTE: I recently updated the design of this site - please let me know if anything looks broken on your device! Thanks!
